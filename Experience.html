    <h3>My Experience</h3><br>

    <b><p style="font-style: candara; font-size: 20px;">Diploma (Oct 2020- Feb 2023)</p></b><br>

    <center><p>My first personal experience started in October 2020, when I got accepted as a UiTM student of the Diploma in Accountancy. Even though I can't go face-to-face class because of the pandemic, I still have a chance to gain experience as a university student. Since I can learn new skills, make new friends, and also learn to make a better future for myself, However, starting in March 2022, in my 4th semester, students were allowed to have face-to-face classes. I am able to experience becoming a real student and meet my diploma friends. </p></center><br>

    <b><p style="font-style: candara; font-size: 20px;">Work(Feb 2023-Mar 2023) </p></b><br>

    <center><p> For the first time in my life, I gained new experience working at my aunt's restaurant. After finishing my diploma and waiting for results to pursue my degree, I decided to work at her restaurant in Kajang for one month. What I have gained from this is that it is not easy because I need to come around 9 a.m. to set up the stall and close the stall at 1 a.m. But it is such a good experience, and I also keep myself disciplined. I have also been exposed to many types of customer behaviour. </p></center><br>

    <b><p style="font-style: candara; font-size: 20px;">Degree (Mar 2023- Currently Dec 2023) </p></b><br>

    <center><p>For the first time, I also had to separate from my family as I continued my degree in Kelantan. This reminds me that when we have grown up, home is just a stopover. It was quite difficult at the beginning. Since my diploma, my house is close to UITM, and I will go home every week. But during my degree, I was only able to return home after mid-semester break and term break.  </p></center><br>

     <b><p style="font-style: candara; font-size: 20px;">Travel (Dec 2023) </p></b><br>

     <p style="text-justify: ;">Last week, on December 22, 2023, I travelled to Thailand with my family, even though we just went by car. However, it was such a good start for my dream to become a traveller when I am already successful in the future. Before this, I had never tried to ride a horse by myself. I decided to try it there, and now I know why people also liked that kind of sport. It is quite exciting, and I think if I got a chance, I would like to learn it in Malaysia. </p>
